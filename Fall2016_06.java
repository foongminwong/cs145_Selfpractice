/*Suppose you’ve got two Scanners:
Scanner inA = new Scanner(...);
Scanner inB = new Scanner(...);
Compare the two input streams token by token. 
(Recall, a token is delimited chunk of text.) 
Where the tokens differ, print a String of the 
form “tokenA != tokenB” (where tokenA is replaced by the token from 
inA and tokenB by the token from inB). You may assume the 
two input streams have the same number of tokens.*/
